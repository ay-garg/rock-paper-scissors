# rock-paper-scissors
A basic real-world game implemented with the use of python language. Player i.e. user will choose the one option out of the three first then computer choses at random. At the starting portion of python script, 'randint" is imported from 'random' library so random integers can be generated from a number of given integers. After the player choses option and computer choses randomly, a if-else condition block is started in which all the conditions are check for each chose option and result is shown.
